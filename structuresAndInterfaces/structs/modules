1. Modules are how Go manages dependence
2. Modules are collections of packages
3. A new module is created using go mod init
   import_path - for example, go mod init linkedInLearning/tempService

4. The go mod command should be run in the project
   root directory

5. go get command will download dependencies
   specified in the go.mod file

6. Remember that we can only define one package
   per directory. We will need to structure our
   project accordingly.


7. In Go, each directory is considered its own
package. Typically, you can name the package any way you'd
like, but the main package is special in Go. When Go
sees that a package is named main it knows the package
should be considered a binary, and should be compiled
into an executable file, instead of a library designed
to be used in another program.
