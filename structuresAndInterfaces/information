1. Go's structs allow us to create custom types and group
   together a collection of fields. They provide a way to integrate
   state and behavior

2. We can export struct outside of package scope by
   capitalizing their first initial character.

3. Structs are initialized with the shorthand syntax
   the struct name, and the field values.

4. dot (.) operator allows both reading and writing to fields.

5. We can omit some fields in the initialization process
   and they will be set to their type's default value.
