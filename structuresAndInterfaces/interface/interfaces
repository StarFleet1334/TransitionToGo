1. Interfaces are collections of method signatures
2. The compiler checks and enforces interface types.
3. Similar to structs, we define interfaces using the
    type and interface keywords, for example:
    type CityTemp interface

4. Structs can implement multiple interfaces.
   , also can implement more method that its interfaces.

5. Zero value of interface is nil

6. Interfaces are built-in pointer type - unlike structs
   , they don't need to be explicitly passed
   by pointer to functions.

7. any type that has method declared in interface
    can satisy that interface
